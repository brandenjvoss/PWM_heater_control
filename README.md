# PWM_heater_control
This program uses PWM to control output from resistive heaters and uses a DS18B20 digital temperature sensor. The intent is to hold an ambient temperature of 60 degrees celcius inside a box used for fuse testing. The heater_output function will provide full heat up to a sensor reading of 55 degrees celsius. Then, the heater will turn off until a reading of 58 is seen (heater continues to radiate heat even when off raising the temp a few degrees more). Output is then modulated to 50% duty cycle from 58-59 and 38% from 59-60. Again, an output of 0 is acheived when the sensor reads higher than 60 degrees celsius. From here, the temperature will fluctuate from 59.31-60.25 degrees celsius and is successfully maintained.
